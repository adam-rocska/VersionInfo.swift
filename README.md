# VersionInfo

Swift VersionInfo is a Swift Package shipping a Swift
library, and a Swift Package Manager Plugin, enabling its
users to statically access their library's or executable's
version info, compiled in their binary without runtime
aspects and without any headaches.

Swift VersionInfo is designed to be used in both server-side
and classical Swift GUI applications, and should be
compatible with all platforms Swift supports.
